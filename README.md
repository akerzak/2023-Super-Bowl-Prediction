# 2023-Super-Bowl-Prediction
Predicting the 2023 Super Bowl winner based on the regular season team rankings for the past 20 super bowls using the Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers

Quick Background: Graduate Assignment to use machine learning models to predict who you thought would be winner of super bowl without providing models or a dataset. Without any more information, students had to find predictive data, choose accurate models, and report who they believed would successfully win the the 2023 superbowl. I found a dataset online with dozens of varibles outlining past superbowl games and ellected to choose a select few to include as my features. Once selected I loaded the data, ran models and wrote the report on my response. In the end I was 1 of the 2 students to successfully predict the winner out of a cohort of 9. 

Run using the pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and multiple sklearn packages. 

superbowl.py houses the code, historical_superbowl_data.csv & 2023_teams_data.csv are the CSV files needed to successfully run the code, and Assingment 2 Report.docx is the written report outlining the completed analysis.
